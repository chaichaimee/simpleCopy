Features and Commands  
1. Append Text to Clipboard  

This function allows you to append selected text to your current clipboard content. If the clipboard is empty, it will simply copy the selected text.  

    Command: Press Shift+C twice quickly (double-press)  
    How it works: The add-on will try to intelligently add line breaks between the existing content and the new text for better formatting.  
    Note: If no text is selected, you will hear "No text selected to append". If the clipboard contains non-text content (e.g., an image), the append operation will fail.  

2. Toggle Append Functionality  

You can enable or disable the append feature of the simpleCopy add-on.  

    Command: Press Windows+C
